Vue.js is a JavaScript front-end framework that was built to organize and simplify web development.

The project focuses on making ideas in web UI development (components, declarative UI, hot-reloading, time-travel debugging, etc.) more approachable. It attempts to be less opinionated and thus easier for developers to pick up.

It features an incrementally adoptable architecture. The core library focuses on declarative rendering and component composition and can be embedded into existing pages. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages
